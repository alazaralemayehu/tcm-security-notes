**There are Fives Stages of Ethical hacking**

1. Reconnaissance 
	- **Active**: Interacting with the system and gathering information
	- **Passive**: Not interacting with the website, Google search, Linkedin,
2. Scanning and Enumeration
	- Using Tools to see the existence of Vulnerabilities and issues with the systems
	- Enumeration: Enumeration the vulnerability against the service running systems
3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)
	- Trying to get an access
4. Maintain Access
	 - Creating a username, having connection to the system
	- Having access even if the system is restarted
5. Covering tracks
	- Deleting information that directs the investigation to us
	- Penetration Testing  

**Information Gathering**
-  In information gathering we have two types of reconnaissance: Active and Passive
****passive reconnaissance stage****

We focus on finding information from publicly available resources. 
 - It can be Physical information like Location information (Satellite images, Drone recon, Building layout {badge readers, break areas, smoking areas, security and fencing}). 
 - It can be Social information Job Information (Employee names, job title, phone number, pictures badge photos, desk photos, computer photos, social media posts).

****Active reconnaissance stage****

We interact with the system actively to know about the services and information about our target. Looking for open ports, subdomains, fingerprinting, trying to connect, pinging....


**Target Validation** (WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon), **finding subdomains** (Google Fu, dig, Nmap, Bluto, Sublist3r,crt.sh), **Fingerprinting** (Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat) and **Finding Data Breaches** (HaveIBeenPwned, Breach-Parse, WeLeakInfo)

**Discovering Email addresses:** useful for marketing and phishing.  
	- Finding the pattern of the email (hunter.io)
	- Finding exact email address  (phonebook.cz)
	- Check the existence of the email
	- check forget password to check connected emails.
