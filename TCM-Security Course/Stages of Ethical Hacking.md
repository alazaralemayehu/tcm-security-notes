**There are Fives Stages of Ethical hacking**

1. Reconnaissance
   - **Active**: Interacting with the system and gathering information
   - **Passive**: Not interacting with the website, Google search, Linkedin,
2. Scanning and Enumeration
   - Using Tools to see the existence of Vulnerabilities and issues with the systems
   - Enumeration: Enumeration the vulnerability against the service running systems
3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)
   - Trying to get an access
4. Maintain Access
   - Creating a username, having connection to the system
   - Having access even if the system is restarted
5. Covering tracks
   - Deleting information that directs the investigation to us
   - Penetration Testing

**Information Gathering**

- In information gathering we have two types of reconnaissance: Active and Passive \***\*passive reconnaissance stage\*\***

We focus on finding information from publicly available resources.

- It can be Physical information like Location information (Satellite images, Drone recon, Building layout {badge readers, break areas, smoking areas, security and fencing}).
- It can be Social information Job Information (Employee names, job title, phone number, pictures badge photos, desk photos, computer photos, social media posts).

\***\*Active reconnaissance stage\*\***

We interact with the system actively to know about the services and information about our target. Looking for open ports, subdomains, fingerprinting, trying to connect, pinging....

**Target Validation** (WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon), **finding subdomains** (Google Fu, dig, Nmap, Bluto, Sublist3r,crt.sh), **Fingerprinting** (Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat) and **Finding Data Breaches** (HaveIBeenPwned, Breach-Parse, WeLeakInfo)
